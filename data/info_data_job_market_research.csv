We want to let you know more about us and our project, but first we're going to share with you a little bit of our history

To achieve this, we are recruiting a team of great professionals, who love technology, innovation, the digital world and of course achieving great challenges. Sounds good.

We were born in 1994 as pioneers in digital banking and since then we have worked to innovate every day. Proof of this is that we launched the first native application for iPad and implemented WhatsApp as a way of communicating with our users. We currently have more than 1 million customers who have placed their trust in us, and that is why we take care of the quality and security of all our services. In 2017 we launched a new web and app platform, using the latest cloud-based technology and with an API layer for all services. That same year we created Open Digital Services (ODS), our technology subsidiary, to recruit the team that would help us achieve our greatest challenge: international growth and technological development. Today, we are developing our Core Banking and have already landed in the Netherlands, Germany and Portugal, and will soon land in Argentina.

As you can see, we haven’t stopped growing and innovating, working in a start-up format, using agile methodologies and making use of the latest technologies. We work with AWS, Microservices Architecture, Mobile Development (iOS and Android) and Big Data Ecosystems among others. Our goal is to take our users' experience to the next level. We are a flexible and fast adapting team, able to work with displaced teams and with a culture that makes us different.

Actualmente buscan un Data Engineer para ser el owner del desarrollo del Data Lake, Data Warehouse, aportando los mejores métodos y de la mejor forma para la ingestión de datos.

El must de stack: Actualmente están migrando todo su data stack a Google Cloud (Bigquery, Composer). Pero, conocedores de que no es tan común el expertise de esta herramienta en el mercado (aunque cada vez se usa más), estarían buscando a alguien que venga de AWS (Redshift y demás) así como Airflow, y tampoco una excesiva seniority, porque la idea es que tenga los fundamentos y dentro de la empresa poder formarse y crecer. A destacar que como Benefit ellos tienen suscripción a una famosa plataforma de aprendizaje, así como tienen asignado tiempo semanal, en horario laboral, para formarse.
Softskills: Ambiente increíble, dicho por varios miembros del equipo, ya que los conocemos desde hace tiempo. Buscarían a alguien dinámico, que le mole el ecosistema startup, y no le de miedo lanzarse a la piscina a aprender cosas nuevas y últimas tecnologías.
Y esto no es todo, además de un paquete de benefits al que habría que añadir mucho team building, y clases de idiomas, se añade su política 100% remote friendly (aunque restringido por ahora a las personas en el mismo huso horario que España), por lo que, si así lo quieres, y más allá del COVID, puedes continuar trabajando desde tu casa, la cafetería o un lugar paradisíaco de la costa ?
Challengue + la leche de compañía + gran ambiente laboral + 100% remote + muchas más cosas.
Cuál es el salario máximo que ofrecen por esta ganga de oportunidad? 45.000 € bruto/anual

(Remote, Full-Time, Anywhere in the World)
 Small niche companies are becoming increasingly successful in the expanding and highly differentiated marketplace we are in today. At Deep Consulting Solutions, we help these companies grow big while staying effective and delivering the best to their clients by replacing their inefficient business processes with automation.

 Do you want to be part of a no-nonsense consultancy that grows successful and effective businesses using business process improvement and customized software that effectively executes business tasks? Our global consulting team is looking for Business Analysts to automate business processes and restructure them for greater efficiency.
 
LinkedIn has limited this job posting to 10,000 characters and we are unable to have the full job posting text here. Please click ""Apply"" and you will be taken to our webpage where you will see the complete job posting text including the requirements for the job, conditions of work, details of hiring process and will be able to start your application.


 What We Do  
We find niche and successful small companies who have problems running their complex internal productions as they scale. Our clients include custom manufacturers, installers, concierge medicine providers, financial services providers, and other custom/concierge service companies. Their operational processes require a lot of manual decisions and it is hard to find and train up employees to execute all these business jobs correctly. We help them lower the need to rely on employees by putting in place automation that will either entirely carry out business jobs or will instruct, organize, and monitor the employees in such a way that employees will have to carry out the least decisions, problematic employees will be quickly identified and the business will be able to produce more with fewer employees and with less management effort by the business owner. Our company carries out the entire service in house, whereby we investigate the business, evaluate it, develop new business processes that will optimize the business and then develop and implement software solutions that will execute their automated business tasks within those new processes.
 Our company guarantees success of our projects to our clients - meaning that if for any reason they aren't satisfied with the outcome, we will take down what we've built and give them their money back. As a result there is a very high demand for and expectation of quality from all staff. We are only looking for people who can produce high quality deliverables and get things done completely and well.


Work Process and Team Structure 
Our company operates on a rigid process and employs a large variety of functional experts in the team. All projects follow a sequence in which our clients' business operation is first thoroughly analyzed and investigated by the Business Analyst who ends up putting together a thorough analysis and and understanding of the business processes used as-is, then evaluates the business model and proposes business model improvements that can be implemented with automation and better process structuring which are then reviewed with Deep Consulting Solutions Owner and then approved upon with the client. The Business Analyst then develops highly detailed theoretical models which will be the modification of all current business processes and models with the agreed upon business improvements and automation implemented into them, that is in effect the target business model that we will be trying to achieve with our project. The target business model is then used to formulate the requirements for a software solution to be put together in order to carry out its business jobs, which is then designed by the software design team, designs are reviewed by the Business Analyst for business model relevance and completeness, and once approved, the software solution is built by our engineering team. Once a software solution is put together and vetted for its quality, it is then assessed by the Business Analyst, and implemented into the business operation - during which, the Business Analyst oversees the implementation and makes sure that the business operation experiences the necessary outcomes out of the project.

In parallel to the above, we also automate relevant accounting processes as part of this process and have dedicated Accounting Procedures & Processes Analysts on our team for that purpose, and the business analyst works closely with them to make sure the accounting processes are an exact fit and match to the business processes implemented. This is incorporated into the above process.

The project teams are kept small in order to make projects easier to organize and to ensure personal responsibility. A project team usually consists of a Business Analyst who is on a project full time, Deep Consulting Solutions Owner who reviews all top level business improvements and keeps an eye on projects quality and execution, other Business Analysts providing peer review, an Accounting Analyst who is usually part-time split between projects, two Software Product Designers who carry out functional design for the software solution and make sure that the solution operates properly and meets the requirements along our tech team which consists of many Software Engineers and Quality Assurance Engineers who usually don't interface with Business Analysts directly but work with the Product Designers who in turn work with the Business Analysts.



What We Will Expect From You 
As the Business Analyst, your ultimate deliverable will be the effectively improved state of client's business delivered through Deep Consulting Solutions' method. This will require of you to both thoroughly and rigorously analyze the client business as it is and to develop business process improvements that can be accomplished through automation and business process restructuring and then to ensure proper implementation of such improvements into the clients' business both with our software implementations and with other business changes not directly connected to software. We will expect you to carry out complete and thorough analysis and make correct decisions and deliver most effectively - in short our expectations will be very high. In order to meet such expectations, you will definitely need to exercise the following at all times (the list is not exhaustive but provides the basic listing of what you will need to exercise at all times):


Carry our truthful, complete, and thorough analysis of the relevant situations, rigorously evaluate all the circumstances and ensure that you understand why things happen the way they do;
Exercise rigorous reasoning in your evaluations and business model proposals, considering all the circumstances and making sure that your evaluations and proposed improvements/business process solutions will be based on facts, aware of and work with the real circumstances of the situation and will not contain plain unjustified assumptions;
Exercise practical awareness in your solutions and business improvement proposals, making sure that what you propose will be practically implementable and will bring the intended result in the given situation;
Carry out your analysis, evaluation and modeling with a high degree of precision and attention to detail, with details being consistent throughout;
Exercise critical evaluation and thinking at all times with regards to your own work and the work of other people who you will either review or peer-review;
Communicate in effective and clear ways that will ensure that the result will be effectively accomplished not only by you but also by other members of the team in such a way that the project overall succeeds.

Generally, you will be free to decide how you structure your work, so long as you produce effective results that meet our quality standard and lead to successfully completed projects. You will be held accountable for the outcomes of your actions, and not your activities. Your given level of responsibility will be determined by your performance, which will be assessed after every project that you complete, leading to matching results in your compensation.

Do you thrive when you explore all of the possibilities for tech to fail or succeed?

ThoughtWorks is a global software consultancy with an aim to create a positive impact on the world through technology. Our community of technologists thinks disruptively to deliver pragmatic solutions for our clients' most complex challenges. We are curious minds who come together as collaborative and inclusive teams to push boundaries, free to be ourselves and make our mark in tech.

Our developers have been contributing code to major organizations and open source projects for over 25 years. They’ve also been writing books, speaking at conferences and helping push software development forward, changing companies and even industries along the way. We passionately believe that software quality is driven by open communication, review and collaboration. That’s why we’re such vehement supporters of open source and have made significant contributions to open source tools for testing, continuous delivery (GoCD), continuous integration (CruiseControl), machine learning and healthcare.

As consultants, we work with our clients to ensure we’re evolving their technology and empowering adaptive mindsets to meet their business goals. You could influence the digital strategy of a retail giant, build a bold new mobile application for a bank or redesign platforms using event sourcing and intelligent data pipelines. You will learn to use the latest Lean and Agile thinking, create pragmatic solutions to solve mission-critical problems and challenge yourself every day.

Woven between all of the stages of the development process is the work of a Quality Analyst: the technologist who sees building solutions like a kaleidoscope of possibilities for things to break. By collaborating with each team member—Developer, Business Analyst, Designer, etc.—they ensure quality is thoughtfully examined in both processes and technology. QAs also aspire to be more than testers; they’re team motivators and strive to encourage all teammates to weave quality into their mindsets and code.

You’ll Spend Time On The Following
You will proactively seek out ways to avoid common software-testing problems such as test case duplication, flaky tests, and maintainability
You will pair with devs to read and analyze code and provide feedback about tests
You will seamlessly partner with clients, Business Analysts, and Project Managers to create and prioritize test plans while establishing yourself as a trusted voice with testing methods, strategies, and tools
You will provide input for and champion system testability
Advocate QA expertise to the broader tech community outside of ThoughtWorks, speaking at conferences and acting as a mentor for more junior-level QAs
Strive for quality to be built and aspire to shift quality to the left
Apply theoretical knowledge to practice and willingly offer improvements on code, tests, testability and suggest tools and frameworks to use
You will examine end-to-end processes in addition to backend testing, ensuring quality is embedded throughout
You will produce and implement test strategies during the software development process
Drive the creation of a reliable automated testing suite with strong reporting capabilities that ensures simple, effective analysis of failures for your team to use
Champion high-functioning teams and enable transitions where necessary
Extend your passion for quality assurance practices to enabling the client, helping coach a client’s team to adopt a testing mindset


Here’s What We’re Looking For
You have worked as a Quality Analyst as part of a wider development team, pairing with Devs and ideally Business Analysts, Infrastructure Engineers, and Designers
You have experience with Agile, code management, deployment strategies and different types of nonfunctional testing
You’re a sleuth when it comes to finding bugs, coming up with scenarios and edge cases along with a solid understanding of best practices such as TDD, BDD, CI/CD and the Practical Test Pyramid
You are comfortable with different types and techniques in functional testing including exploratory, boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning
You have exposure to and experience in using defect tracking and management tools
An understanding of how to perform better white box testing using code
You know what a test strategy is and can produce one and you’re able to zoom out to the big picture and identify gaps in quality
You’re resilient in ambiguous situations and can approach and tackle challenges from multiple perspectives
You are seen as an influential team leader and always advocate for quality as a shared team responsibility, yet are open to change when needed
An ability to assess strengths amongst your teammates and distribute quality-related tasks when needed
Bonus points if you have familiarity with automated deployment processes, notions of configuration management like SVN and GIT, and a track record of innovation in testing

Who You'll Work With

As part of this group, you’ll join a global team working on everything from IT modernization and strategy to agile, cloud, cybersecurity, and digital transformation. You’ll typically work on projects across all industries and functions and will be fully integrated with the rest of our global firm.

You’ll also work with colleagues from across McKinsey & Company to help our clients deliver breakthrough products, experiences, and businesses, both on technology and non-technology topics.

Our office culture is casual and social, with an emphasis on education and innovation. We have the freedom to try new ideas, experiment and are expected to be constantly learning and growing. There is also a strong emphasis on mentoring others in the group, enabling them to grow and learn.

When you join McKinsey as a Business Analyst (BA), you are joining a firm that will challenge you and invest in your professional development. In this role you will work on the best teams to help the best organizations in the world – in private, public, and social sectors – solve their most difficult problems. You will also work with many experts, from data scientists and researchers to software and app designers.

Additionally, you’ll receive guidance and support from your local office in the selection of client projects, helping you to develop your skills and build your network.

We view the BA position as the start of a rewarding, challenging, and highly flexible career with McKinsey. During your first few years with the firm, you will serve as a BA on multiple client engagements and work with a number of colleagues and clients in a range of industry and functional areas. We encourage you to explore different content areas or geographies through a 2 year-long rotation with one of our practices (e.g., corporate finance, social sector, healthcare, operations) or global offices; many do this after two years as a generalist BA.

Following your BA tenure, assuming good performance, you will move into a post-graduate school role. Some BAs will take advantage of the opportunity to get outside experience through a secondment (externship) with a private sector or social sector client with the firm’s support. Others may choose to pursue graduate school with support from the firm.

117,Ironhack,Mid-Senior Data Analyst,Madrid, 1 mes,456,Algo de responsabilidad,Servicios y tecnologías de la información Software Internet,Media jornada,Tecnología de la información,"#About Ironhack

Ironhack is an education startup that was founded to disrupt the way tech education works!

Doesn’t it seem odd that we’ve been learning the same way since the Industrial Revolution? Virtually all industries are pushing the limits on how to do things faster, better, and more efficiently. Yet, for the most part, people feel stuck on a 4+ year (and usually quite expensive) path that often results in an unfulfilling career path.

We empower students to create a new path - one that leads to meaningful careers in software development, product design or data analytics in a fraction of the time and cost of traditional education.

Our higher purpose is to transform the education space to be unapologetically outcomes-driven. Whether students are looking to change careers, get a promotion, skip University, or start their own company, we work tirelessly every day to make sure this path is as quick, immersive, and accessible as possible. Hearing these success stories is what gets us out of bed each day, excited to come to work :)

It’s with this mindset that we’ve become one of the key global players in bridging the digital skills gap, serving both those looking to get into tech, as well as the companies hungry for tech talent.

Quick Facts
Founded in 2013 by Wharton and Harvard grads
Operations in Miami, Madrid, Barcelona, Paris, Mexico City, Lisbon, Amsterdam, Sao Paulo and Berlin
100% YoY Growth (help us to keep it going!)
Graduated over 6500 students
100+ global team members
Venture capital backed
About The Gig

A large part of the success of Ironhack depends on the data we have. The Data Analyst plays a critical role in ensuring we have good quality and accessibility to our the data, enabling us to make better decisions for our students.

We’re looking for a Data Analyst that will work transforming Ironhack into a more data-driven organization. The role is based in Madrid, although we will work remotely from Spain (we may want to meet onsite from time to time).

Ironhack is becoming a data-driven organization; we are in the early stages of it, so you will be key in achieving it as a Data Analyst.

We Are Working Hard On Three Main Points
Making data available to everyone (developing a platform that provides accessibility and autonomy to the employees to query the data)
Spreading the knowledge of data around the company: an essential part of autonomy is to be able to extract valuable knowledge from the data. That’s why we are training all the Ironhack’s employees on necessary data skills.
Improving the quality of our data: data is useless if the quality is low. We are working hard on being aware of the quality of the data.
In the future, we’ll work also on providing Advanced Analytics to the company, such as forecasting, clustering, and different Machine Learning and statistics techniques. So the challenges are varied, and you will be able to develop yourself in different areas.

You will be close to
Technical aspects of the data such as analysis, quality, reporting, and generation
Non-technical aspects of the data: working on our culture, helping people to be autonomous
You will be responsible for
Definition, analysis, design, and development of data quality models
Definition, analysis, design, and development of analytical processes and models
Training employees in basic data skills such as dashboarding, querying and analyzing data
Developing business cases to focus on the market with higher potential impact
Data lineage and governance
Your day-to-day. We work with agile methodologies, so you will know your priorities, but also you will be responsible for how you plan your day-to-day work.
Your Skills And Experience
At least 3 years of experience as Data Analyst
Degree in a Quantitative field or related courses
Demonstrated knowledge of BI projects
Demonstrated hands-on experience with a programming language (R, Python, etc)
Demonstrated experience on relational databases: design, manipulate and query the data in Postgresql
Data Preparation (Cleansing and Standardization). Use of Python to transform, clean and store data in different formats.
Analytic models: proven knowledge and experience on classical models (classification, regression, time series, clustering, etc.)
Being a team player is a must
Hands-on experience building a strong governance environment
Experience in working and delivering end-to-end projects independently
Liking and understanding how to work in an agile environment
Comfortable with English speaking
What we offer in the data team
The possibility to learn about many different business processes: we work with the marketing team, education, sales, etc. You will learn what their main processes are and how they use the data
The possibility to work with people from different countries. It is always interesting to know better different cultures
We are a small team with high impact
30 - 35k gross year, depending on the profile
Is this you?
Passionate about education and technology!
Comfortable embracing a culture of constant experimentation
Really positive, upbeat, and social
Encouraged by challenges and enjoy having tons of autonomy with no bureaucratic BS
Likes to work in a small team with a variety of challenges

The convergence of these two trends means that a disruptive approach to last-mile delivery is not a nice-to-have but rather an inevitability.

Stuart sits at the crossroads of the future, using our best-in-class proprietary dispatch technology to connect small and big businesses alike to a shared fleet of geolocalised couriers. The result? Efficient, reliable, eco-friendly delivery to help retailers to meet their customers’ demands.

We launched in 2015 with a big vision and a handful of clients. Three and a half years later, couriers on our platform complete tens of millions of deliveries annually for the biggest brands across retail, eCommerce, grocery and food.

Stuart is an equal opportunity employer and we value diversity at our company. We don't discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status or disability status.

That same year we created Open Digital Services (ODS), our technology subsidiary, to recruit the team that would help us achieve our greatest challenge: international growth and technological development. Today, we are developing our Core Banking and have already landed in the Netherlands, Germany and Portugal, and will soon land in Argentina.

We work with AWS, Microservices Architecture, Mobile Development (iOS and Android) and Big Data Ecosystems among others. Our goal is to take our users' experience to the next level. We are a flexible and fast adapting team, able to work with displaced teams and with a culture that makes us different.

220,ThoughtWorks,Senior Quality Analyst,Barcelona, 1 semana,163,no_data,Software Servicios y tecnologías de la información,Jornada completa,Control de calidad,"Are you at your most motivated when you get to break things? Do you thrive when you explore all of the possibilities for tech to fail or succeed?

ThoughtWorks is a global software consultancy with an aim to create a positive impact on the world through technology. Our community of technologists thinks disruptively to deliver pragmatic solutions for our clients' most complex challenges. We are curious minds who come together as collaborative and inclusive teams to push boundaries, free to be ourselves and make our mark in tech.

Our developers have been contributing code to major organizations and open source projects for over 25 years. They’ve also been writing books, speaking at conferences and helping push software development forward, changing companies and even industries along the way. We passionately believe that software quality is driven by open communication, review and collaboration. That’s why we’re such vehement supporters of open source and have made significant contributions to open source tools for testing, continuous delivery (GoCD), continuous integration (CruiseControl), machine learning and healthcare.

As consultants, we work with our clients to ensure we’re evolving their technology and empowering adaptive mindsets to meet their business goals. You could influence the digital strategy of a retail giant, build a bold new mobile application for a bank or redesign platforms using event sourcing and intelligent data pipelines. You will learn to use the latest Lean and Agile thinking, create pragmatic solutions to solve mission-critical problems and challenge yourself every day.

Woven between all of the stages of the development process is the work of a Quality Analyst: the technologist who sees building solutions like a kaleidoscope of possibilities for things to break. By collaborating with each team member—Developer, Business Analyst, Designer, etc.—they ensure quality is thoughtfully examined in both processes and technology. QAs also aspire to be more than testers; they’re team motivators and strive to encourage all teammates to weave quality into their mindsets and code.

You’ll Spend Time On The Following
You will proactively seek out ways to avoid common software-testing problems such as test case duplication, flaky tests, and maintainability
You will pair with devs to read and analyze code and provide feedback about tests
You will provide input for and champion system testability
Advocate QA expertise to the broader tech community outside of ThoughtWorks, speaking at conferences and acting as a mentor for more junior-level QAs
Strive for quality to be built and aspire to shift quality to the left
Apply theoretical knowledge to practice and willingly offer improvements on code, tests, testability and suggest tools and frameworks to use
You will examine end-to-end processes in addition to backend testing, ensuring quality is embedded throughout
You will produce and implement test strategies during the software development process
Drive the creation of a reliable automated testing suite with strong reporting capabilities that ensures simple, effective analysis of failures for your team to use
Champion high-functioning teams and enable transitions where necessary
Extend your passion for quality assurance practices to enabling the client, helping coach a client’s team to adopt a testing mindset


Here’s What We’re Looking For
You have worked as a Quality Analyst as part of a wider development team, pairing with Devs and ideally Business Analysts, Infrastructure Engineers, and Designers

229,Returnly,Senior Data Analyst,Madrid, 2 meses,758,Algo de responsabilidad,Software Internet Servicios financieros,Jornada completa,Tecnología de la información,"About Returnly

At Returnly, we help brands that care about shopper loyalty offer better product returns. We are a financial technology services company that builds award-winning products that drive repurchase behavior and customer loyalty. We’re backed by smart money VCs in Fintech including some prominent members of the Paypal Mafia. Our headquarters are in San Francisco Financial District and we have offices in Chicago and Madrid. We are on a mission to de-risk online commerce and are building a team of amazingly talented people to help us do it.

About The Role

At Returnly, we value you as a whole person. We care about the skillset you bring to the table, but more importantly, we care about the kind of person you are and the culture and attitude that you bring. As a Senior Data Analyst, you will work with our Product, Marketing, Data Science, Sales, Customer Success, and Finance teams to define and create meaningful analyses to help drive revenue, fix processes, and monitor impact. You will become an expert in our merchant and shopper data and seek to use that knowledge to provide an enhanced product experience using tools such as SQL, Python, Looker, statistics, machine learning, etc. This is a cross-functional role in which you’ll work with the Director of Analytics as well as the CEO, CTO and other members of Leadership to help prioritize the data projects that will have the biggest impact for Returnly merchants and shoppers.

What do we offer?

Remoteness

We have an office, and we prefer seeing each other often, but we already had a healthy WFH culture before Covid-19 came so when it happened, we just switched to every-day WFH. However, we would prefer if you live in or near Madrid so when we open the office again it won’t be a problem for you to enjoy it.

Schedule

We have a very flexible approach to working hours. You can stop to go to the gym, get your little ones to or from school, meditate or do whatever you need or want. There is a need for a certain amount of overlap with Pacific Coast working hours needed for meetings and collaboration that does not fit into asynchronous communications, however we try to prioritise those, and your main collaborators are based on Spain.

We integrate the complete process of selecting, hiring, and managing employees, being the first in digitizing all the steps, introducing Artificial Intelligence solutions in multiple phases, obtaining faster and higher-quality service for our clients, and great satisfaction and loyalty for our workers.
Our Impact on Society: Our vision is to create a long-term job security condition for our workers while providing flexible solutions to our clients. We can do this by concatenating different short-term contracts and minimizing–or completely removing–their unemployed time. We want to remove the need for finding a job ever again. 
Data-Driven: Being the owner of the entire hiring funnel, workforce management, and working experience, give us very unique data that we transform into powerful knowledge to make better decisions, improve job-candidate matches, estimate quality and affinity, and share performance feedback with our workers and clients. We are the most advanced workforce on-demand company thanks to our data and the way we use it.
Great Challenges for the Data Team: Integrating very different AI solutions to improve the experience for both our workers and employers (Shift Optimization, Machine Learning algorithms, Quality Score Estimations, Document recognition, etc.), relying on a very powerful ETL that permits endless automatizations while keeping the focus on data quality.
Growth Overview: An annual growth of 170%, available in multiple countries: the UK, Spain, Germany, Sweden, Mexico, Colombia, France, and more are coming. HQ in Madrid with a second big presence in Barcelona and some remote workers in the UK, The Netherlands, and the USA. And finally, some of our great clients are Amazon, XPOLogistics, Cabify, Santander, Just Eat, etc. 

Join us in one of the hottest startups in Spain, breaking into a new market worldwide, learning and contributing with your expertise in innovating the entire job market!
 Be the main referent of our Python code, help to raise the quality bar of any Python code we use. 

We use Airflow as our ETL, a very powerful Python framework that allows us to break down any complex problem/process into smaller ones. Each component can be implemented directly in Python, or in any other language since they could be docker images executed in ECS instances. 

The main priority is a senior profile with extremely solid Python skills, previous experience with Data/ETL is nice-to-have but it is not mandatory.

Overall, we can resume the main responsibilities as follow:
Raise the level of our Python good practices, code structure, cleaning, and testing.
Design and implement high-quality and performant Python code within our powerful ETL.
Automate external integrations with our Data Lake and Data Warehouse.
Automate complex solutions that might require to train, build, and deploy a series of Machine Learning algorithms (no previous experience with ML required). 
 In addition, we are looking for a senior profile that could be interested in:
Mentor mid- and junior- Python Engineer: given the great impact of our ETL on the entire company, we want to grow a team dedicated to it, capable of improving, maintaining, and boosting it even further.
Sharing her/his knowledge inside and outside Jobandtalent, raising the quality standards of the entire team with the aim of growing together.
Contributing to Open Source projects: we are using different Open Source frameworks and libraries, and one of our wishes would be to contribute to some of those projects, dedicating part of our time when possible. 

Requirements and Skills
Bachelor’s degree in Math, Engineering, Stats, or Quantitative field.
4+ years of proven experience programming in Python with production-ready code (not scripting code).
Extremely skilled programmer (e.g., unittest, production/staging experience).
Experience with
Different kinds of standard databases (e.g., RDBMS, NoSQL).
Container development with Docker or Kubernetes.

Experience with Big-data frameworks and OLAP DBs 
Stream processing framework (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, Spark, Flink).
A valid work permit to be employed in Spain.
Fluent in English is a must.

Examples of Projects and Responsibilities
You receive a Jupyter Notebook made by one of our Data Analysts which contained a prototype of a data processing pipeline that generate very important data for our stakeholder. The Data Analyst has previously confirmed the data is corrected, but the code is definitely not ready for production. You need to understand it, define which is the best way to automate it (Airflow Python DAG, using Spark, external tools, etc.), and start the implementation by yourself or together with other team members.
The previous example works in a similar way for Data Scientists when they come requesting help with automation about how to train a Machine Learning model that we want to re-evaluate on a weekly basis. Ideally, we want the results of the evaluation to be automatically computed and shared via a Slack channel, so we can quickly review them and decide if the model can be moved to production.
We are expecting you to raise the quality bar of our code: helping your team members understanding which is the best way to structure the code for a specific problem, defining better protocols, introducing metrics when they are missing, improve the code performance, etc.

Offer in Short
Great ownership of the projects with a direct impact on the product.
Salary in the 55-70k range (wide range, depending on experience).
Transparent Equity package.
Discount on Health insurance.
A yearly budget for Conferences/meetup/self-learning.
Working in an international and multidisciplinary team 
You will be working in the Data Science team (read the last blog posts), together with Full-stack Engineers, Data Scientists, and Data Analysts.

From finding documents to monitoring infrastructure to hunting for threats, Elastic makes data usable in real-time and at scale. Thousands of organizations worldwide, including Barclays, Cisco, eBay, Fairfax, ING, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, The Mayo Clinic, NASA, The New York Times, Wikipedia, and Verizon, use Elastic to power mission-critical systems. Founded in 2012, Elastic is a distributed company with Elasticians around the globe. Learn more at elastic.co.

The Observability team is in charge of developing solutions that focus on application developers and engineers that run infrastructure and services supporting these applications. Elasticsearch is an efficient datastore for logs, metrics, and application traces, supporting the three pillars of observability. The Observability team builds and maintains solutions that make getting insights from this data turnkey and efficient, such as our APM, Metrics, Logs and Uptime solutions. When developing these solutions, we think about the problem end-to-end: how do we automatically collect data from common data sources, how do we store it efficiently in Elasticsearch, how do we present this information to the user, what actions do we take on the insights from the data? All of these aspects are important in bringing a turnkey solution to the market.

The Observability team is looking for a Data Scientist to develop machine learning technologies to help with root cause analysis, anomaly detection and performance improvement in Logs, Metrics, APM and Synthetic Monitoring data. We value autonomy, curiosity, fastidiousness, and questioning the status quo.

You don’t always need to be the person with the answer or the person making the decisions, but instead should be able to guide discussions to help the team make decisions together.

What you will be doing

Working as part of the Observability team at Elastic, with other machine learning specialists and engineers
Your primary focus will be the successful training, evaluating, and delivery of Observability ML integrations, correlations and root cause analysis workflows
Automate collection of customer feedback data in order to make our models better
Design small-scale experiments to understand new data and determine concept drift
Design dashboards to explain efficacy and performance of current vs. historical models
Participate in collaborative efforts to improve our ML jobs with the ML team and other engineers
You will be encouraged to design and prototype machine learning models to demonstrate real-time Observability data to provide anomaly detection
Design and develop data-driven solutions that can run against millions of Observability data points

What you will bring along

5+ years of machine learning experience; strong preference for a focus on Observability problems
Solid understanding of deep learning, clustering, and graph algorithms
Experience working within engineering teams and being able to apply engineering solutions to data science problems
Experience using or developing data pipelines including the collection, normalization, storage, and API access of complex event data
Proficient programming skills and experience using ML-related libraries
Ability to synthesize evaluation metrics, customer feedback, and internal analysis to tell a clear story of model performance
Passion for providing novel contributions on machine learning techniques
Experience as a hands-on software engineer so you understand the core principles of the engineering work that is going on in your team
A conscientious approach to communication, a good sense of humour, and a genuine interest in the success and growth of the people you work with
Experience with observability, monitoring, and AIOps solutions
Ability to work in a fast paced and highly autonomous environment
Experience training models using scikit-learn, xgboost, PyTorch/Tensorflow is a plus

To help deliver our educational content to millions of families, we’re looking for a Data Engineer to work on our Data Platform team.

At Lingokids, we encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. We actively seek to hire individuals with different perspectives, and we are eager to continue diversifying our company's culture. We strive to be an inclusive, supportive place where you can do the best work of your career.

Our offices are in Madrid, Spain, but the position is open to anyone with experience working remotely. Some overlap with Central European Time is expected though, for those times when a video call is the most efficient way to communicate.

About the job:

Our Data Platform is what supports the Analytics needs and data-driven projects of the company. It is built around a modern ELT pipeline deployed on AWS and uses Python, Spark, dbt, Redshift, and a range of AWS services.

As a Data Engineer on our Data Engineering Squad, you will support, improve and extend our Data Platform. Your work will empower our Analysts and Data Scientists, enable data-driven Product features, and generally support the data-informed culture at Lingokids.
More specifically, you will:

Design, build and support modern and scalable data pipelines using 3rd party platforms or internal solutions.
Collaborate with data scientists, other engineers, and stakeholders to understand what data is required and how best to make it available in our Data Platform.
Support the daily work of our Data Scientists by ensuring they have easy access to data and tools (development environment, notebook instances, etc.).
Write and maintain code to orchestrate our ETL workflows.
Improve the design and data feeding of our Data Lake.
Help and train Data Scientists to optimize SQL queries for performance.
Provide data and infrastructure for building and deploying ML models to production.
Use best practices around CI/CD, automation, testing, and monitoring of analytics pipelines (inspired by DataOps).

About you:

The ideal teammate for us would be someone who believes that communication, empathy, inquisitiveness, and open-mindedness are fundamental to being successful in any endeavor.

You should:

Be interested in building a platform that enables our Data Analysts and Data Scientists.
Be fluent with one or more high-level programming languages (Python, Ruby, Java, Scala, or similar).
Be comfortable with analytical SQL.
Be familiar with software development best practices and their applications to Analytics (version control, testing, CI/CD, automation).
Have experience building modern ETL pipelines, possibly at a large scale.
Have experience working with a modern data warehouse (Redshift, Snowflake, BigQuery, or similar).
A self-driven approach to learning new technologies and moving projects forward.

We consider the following as nice to have:

Experience working with Data Scientists and Analysts.
An interest in data quality and governance.
Experience in the BigData ecosystem (Hadoop, Spark, PrestoDB, …).
Experience with a Cloud Data Warehouse (Redshift, Snowflake, …).
Familiarity with infrastructure and automation tools (Terraform, Ansible, or similar).

English is a must. We are a multicultural team, and we are providing a service in English so, we don't care about certificates, but we expect you to be able to communicate fluently.
You should feel equally comfortable communicating in long-form writing. Given the circumstances, we have become a fully remote company. We are firm believers that being articulate in both spoken and written long-form asynchronous communication is key to working efficiently together.

If you think you don't tick all the boxes, we'd still love to hear from you. Nobody checks every box, and we are looking for someone excited to join the team.

Benefits of working at Lingokids

Flexible hours and remote working. We care about the results you bring to the team. 9 to 6 and constant commuting is not for us either.
Visa Sponsorship. If you need a visa to work in the EU, Lingokids will assist you during the visa process, costs-included.
Feedback culture. Feedback is the breakfast of champions, and we take it seriously!
Professional growth. Up to €2.000 per year for conferences, books and training.
Language Lessons. Language learning is what we’re all about! We’ll cover language classes for you to learn Spanish, English or Portuguese.
Stock options. Joining Lingokids means you can choose to own part of the company.
Free Friday lunch. Company allowance to be able to order lunch every Friday with Deliveroo!
Happy Hours & Retreats. From casual drinks after work to our annual retreat, you’ll have tons of opportunities to get to know your colleagues.
Diverse environment. Multicultural team with +19 nationalities and day-to-day work in English.

625,BMAT Music Innovators,"Data Engineer - Digital music distribution, Python",Barcelona, 6 días,177,Algo de responsabilidad,Servicios y tecnologías de la información,Jornada completa,Ingeniería Tecnología de la información,"About BMAT 

BMAT started in 2005 when a group of engineers with a passion for music decided to spin-off from an audio research lab in Barcelona. The company started with an idea – to index all the music in the world – and a mission – to better the music eco-system – and a team of nerds eager to learn how to build a successful business. Today the company has grown to more than a hundred people - spread across Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Lima, Los Angeles, Milan, São Paulo, London, Paris, Oslo, New York, Johannesburg, Singapore, Tokyo, and Moscow - that team up to deliver daily 1 million identifications and 3 billion matches to our partners from all over the music industry.
 
 Our Culture 

We love music. It makes our lives a zillion times better. And we want to give something back to her (yes, to us music is a lady). Make her life easier and her future brighter. We apply our scientific, data-infused brains to tell everyone what music has been played – so that creators get the recognition they deserve. We hear everything everywhere and tell everyone who wants to know. ‘What plays around will come back around’ we say. We believe by helping this happen we can make a positive change in the music ecosystem and enjoy talent for another million years.

We are a team of pretty decent people who enjoy working with each other. We’re open-minded and well-traveled, coming from all parts of the world. We like coffee, tea, chai, and mate all the same. We’ve got rappers, producers, cello players, DJs, and songwriters. The passion for music, the excitement for technology and Barcelona as a backdrop has proven to make a good combination. We say there is a BMAT touch. We believe it has to do with being passionate, obsessive, nice, generous, honest, self-motivated, entrepreneurial, intrepid, crazy, extraordinary, creative, agile, human, friendly, smart, witty, talented, naive, optimistic, surprising, sensual, and nerdy, but not very hipster (unfortunately).

 What You Will Be Doing
 As part of the engineering team of the Digital business unit, your responsibilities will be to build, improve and scale the products that power one of the most complete music data processing systems in the world. We use agile values to improve our day to day performance. We are connected to more than 45 digital service providers such as Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music, Deezer or Amazon. They provide us with digital sales reports (DSRs), which we parse, reconcile, match and translate into royalty statements, among others, in order to provide insight to our partners, the collective management organisations and publishers of the world.

In addition, we also provide on-demand audio identification services that enable our partners to be in control of user-generated content (e.g. YouTube, Facebook, SoundCloud) and increase revenues and traceability from videos containing their music.

Our digital distribution system has already processed 162.000 DSRs with 87 billion transactions from over 250 countries, and currently ingests 650 million online music transactions per month
in a horizontally scalable architecture powered by Amazon Web Services. Our main development technology is Python along with some of its frameworks, such as Django and Flask. We also use Docker to speed up our developments and deployments.
 Moreover at BMAT we want to have the most complete music metadata database in the world. As part of our team you will help dealing with tons of music metadata, to help us reach our goal faster, adding value to the team and creating cool stuff.
   All About You

Code with test coverage.

The company started with an idea – to index all the music in the world – and a mission – to better the music eco-system – and a team of nerds eager to learn how to build a successful business. Today the company has grown to more than a hundred people - spread across Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Lima, Los Angeles, Milan, São Paulo, London, Paris, Oslo, New York, Johannesburg, Singapore, Tokyo, and Moscow - that team up to deliver daily 1 million identifications and 3 billion matches to our partners from all over the music industry.
 
 Our Culture 

We love music. It makes our lives a zillion times better. And we want to give something back to her (yes, to us music is a lady). Make her life easier and her future brighter. We apply our scientific, data-infused brains to tell everyone what music has been played – so that creators get the recognition they deserve. We hear everything everywhere and tell everyone who wants to know. ‘What plays around will come back around’ we say. We believe by helping this happen we can make a positive change in the music ecosystem and enjoy talent for another million years.

We are a team of pretty decent people who enjoy working with each other. We’re open-minded and well-traveled, coming from all parts of the world. We like coffee, tea, chai, and mate all the same. We’ve got rappers, producers, cello players, DJs, and songwriters. The passion for music, the excitement for technology and Barcelona as a backdrop has proven to make a good combination. We say there is a BMAT touch. We believe it has to do with being passionate, obsessive, nice, generous, honest, self-motivated, entrepreneurial, intrepid, crazy, extraordinary, creative, agile, human, friendly, smart, witty, talented, naive, optimistic, surprising, sensual, and nerdy, but not very hipster (unfortunately).

 What You Will Be Doing
 As part of the engineering team of the Digital business unit, your responsibilities will be to build, improve and scale the products that power one of the most complete music data processing systems in the world. We use agile values to improve our day to day performance. We are connected to more than 45 digital service providers such as Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music, Deezer or Amazon. They provide us with digital sales reports (DSRs), which we parse, reconcile, match and translate into royalty statements, among others, in order to provide insight to our partners, the collective management organisations and publishers of the world.

In addition, we also provide on-demand audio identification services that enable our partners to be in control of user-generated content (e.g. YouTube, Facebook, SoundCloud) and increase revenues and traceability from videos containing their music.

Our digital distribution system has already processed 162.000 DSRs with 87 billion transactions from over 250 countries, and currently ingests 650 million online music transactions per month
in a horizontally scalable architecture powered by Amazon Web Services. Our main development technology is Python along with some of its frameworks, such as Django and Flask. We also use Docker to speed up our developments and deployments.
 Moreover at BMAT we want to have the most complete music metadata database in the world. As part of our team you will help dealing with tons of music metadata, to help us reach our goal faster, adding value to the team and creating cool stuff.

Our team is made up of people with different backgrounds, perspectives, orientations, abilities, musical tastes, dress sense and time-zones - but we all have one common goal: Making the music world a better place. With equal opportunities for everyone, BMAT is a pretty nice place to work.

Our power

Our power

Enza Zaden is a vegetable breeding company that develops vegetable varieties. We produce and sell the seeds of these varieties all over the world. Both for conventional and organic growers. Our goal is to grant people access to healthy vegetables. Anywhere in the world. Every day, more than 460 million people worldwide eat our vegetables. So, we are getting there ... but there is still enough work to be done! Of course, we look further than present needs. In 2050, when there will be about 10 billion inhabitants on our planet, we also want to make sure that people have access to healthy vegetables. To achieve this, our vegetable breeders work with the best that nature offers. Supported by state-of-the-art technologies to speed up our breeding process. And that is really necessary, because currently the development of a new vegetable variety takes at least 6 years. We focus on higher yield, resistance to diseases and pests and climate extremes such as heat and drought. And on taste, shelf life and nutrients. The results? Strong, healthy tasty and climate-proof vegetable varieties with higher yield per square meter and less need of crop protection products or fertilizer. In short, sustainability is truly in our DNA.

Si quieres participar en el reto que supone trabajar y aprender en una de las historias de éxito más importantes del panorama nacional, queremos saber de ti.

¿Cómo será tu día a día?

Investigación de mejoras de los modelos existente: propuesta de hipótesis, investigación y conclusiones *accionables* son nuestro ABC.
Desarrollo de nuevos modelos que no existían previamente para los cuales hay que plantear soluciones interesantes. Por ejemplo, sistemas de recomendación, optimización de canales de marketing, medición de A/B testing con multi-armed bandits o detección de anomalías son algunos de los retos que tenemos que resolver.
Desarrollo Python, hacemos ciencia de datos y por lo tanto hacemos software (bien). Estamos trabajando duramente para que a final del Q1 cumplamos el  Joel Test en su totalidad
Comunicación y más comunicación con el resto de las áreas. Somos un equipo cross que permea en toda la compañía y tiene afán de transmitir.
Participar en la mejora del plan estratégico y añadir ideas al backlog es parte de tu responsabilidad. No somos un producto sencillo y hay retos en todas partes que requieren soluciones ingeniosas. Trabajamos muchísimo con los equipos de producto para crear una visión a largo plazo de productos basados en datos.

Curiosidad intelectual y crecimiento personal: Hacemos ciencia, somos inquietos, tenemos curiosidad, nos hacemos preguntas que nadie nos ha preguntado y damos respuestas que nos sorprenden a nosotros mismos. El aprendizaje es el principal motor de tu propio plan de crecimiento personal.

Trabajo en equipo: los problemas y éxitos de cada uno son de todos. Colaboramos de forma autónoma y nos interesamos por los retos de nuestros compañeros (de Data y otras áreas)
Autonomía responsable: somos muy flexibles con la forma de trabajo de cada uno: trabajo en remoto, de forma asíncrona, permitiendo la conciliación y la autonomía en la ejecución.

The videos above are UK centric, but our current interest is Europe wide. Feel free to research the other markets. This is a longer video that to me explains why there is such large opportunity going forward for the electricity traders who are able to efficiently analyse supply and demand fundamentals and move power between countries, for the benefit of all.

694,Jobandtalent,Lead Data Engineer (Data Team),Barcelona, 3 semanas,424,no_data,Internet,Jornada completa,Tecnología de la información,"Who we are: We are a workforce on-demand company that heavily relies on tech. We integrate the complete process of selecting, hiring, and managing employees, being the first in digitizing all the steps, introducing Artificial Intelligence solutions in multiple phases, obtaining faster and higher-quality service for our clients, and great satisfaction and loyalty for our workers.
Our Impact on Society: Our vision is to create a long-term job security condition for our workers while providing flexible solutions to our clients. We can do this by concatenating different short-term contracts and minimizing–or completely removing–their unemployed time. We want to remove the need for finding a job ever again. 
Data-Driven: Being the owner of the entire hiring funnel, workforce management, and working experience, give us very unique data that we transform into powerful knowledge to make better decisions, improve job-candidate matches, estimate quality and affinity, and share performance feedback with our workers and clients. We are the most advanced workforce on-demand company thanks to our data and the way we use it.
Great Challenges for the Data Team: Integrating very different AI solutions to improve the experience for both our workers and employers (Shift Optimization, Machine Learning algorithms, Quality Score Estimations, Document recognition, etc.), relying on a very powerful ETL that permits endless automatizations while keeping the focus on data quality.
Growth Overview: An annual growth of 170%, available in multiple countries: the UK, Spain, Germany, Sweden, Mexico, Colombia, France, and more are coming. HQ in Madrid with a second big presence in Barcelona and some remote workers in the UK, The Netherlands, and the USA. And finally, some of our great clients are Amazon, XPOLogistics, Cabify, Santander, Just Eat, etc. 
 You will be the main referent of our data architecture, leading the design and implementation decisions of our data pipelines. This role includes the possibility of managing the Data Automation team. 
 The Data Team is very independent of the rest of the Tech and Product teams. We build and manage our services that run our AI models as well as our data storages to quickly process the data we need, and let the Data Scientist performing the “Time Travel” to properly train our algorithms. A quick insight about our architecture and tools:
We are building our new data lake and data warehouse directly in AWS S3, synchronizing the data via DMS, and consolidate it via Hudi. This data will be accessible by multiple Redshift  clusters that allow us to quickly scale-up across all the countries. In addition as data is stored in S3 this could be exploited via Athena or an ad-hoc Spark job. 
We have multiple queue systems from which we consume data coming from the JobandTalent Message broker  while filling up our data storage. 
We use Airflow as our ETL which allows us to break down any complex problem/process into smaller ones. Each component can be implemented directly in Python, or any other language since we could execute any docker container in AWS Fargate. 
We are integrating different 3rd party data (Kustomer, Salesforce, etc.). We keep iterating in the best way to incorporate this data to our Datalake which allow our users to exploit this data.
 You need to have proven experience in these areas, being eager to learn and improve, while enjoying taking responsibility. You need to be very hands-on, able to explore different solutions to our problems and needs.  
 Requirements and Skills
Technical degree preferably in Engineering or Quantitative field.
Experience managing ETL or similar Data Workflows 
Experience in leading data architecture decisions and similar responsibilities.
Previous practical experience with Big Data technologies knowledge, batch and real-time (Hadoop, Spark, Hudi, Spark Streaming, Flink, etc.).
Extensive experience with production-ready code (not scripting code).
Extremely skilled programmer (e.g., unittest, production/staging experience). 
Python proficiency, and ideally experience with other programming languages such as Java, Scala.
Strong knowledge of different data storages (knows pros and cons, understand and investigate the best solution for each use-case).
Strong knowledge of different storage formats (JSON, Parquet, Avro, etc.), understand and investigate the best solution for each use-case.
Streaming data queue platforms knowledge (Kinesis, Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.).
Excellent verbal and written communication skills; ability to communicate effectively with different levels of management, as well as the business and technical communities.
A valid work permit to be employed in Spain.
Fluent in English is a must.
 Besides, we are looking for a senior profile that will be interested in:
Managing a team of mid and junior Engineers, taking ownership of the key decisions, introducing new standards and protocols, helping them to grow, etc.
Sharing knowledge inside and outside Jobandtalent writing blog posts and/or giving talks, raising the quality standards of the entire team to grow together.
Contributing to Open Source projects: we are using different Open Source frameworks and libraries, and one of our wishes would be to contribute to some of those projects, dedicating part of our time when possible. 
 Offer in Short
Great ownership of the projects with a direct impact on the product.
Salary in the 55-70k range (wide range, depending on experience).
Transparent Equity package.
Discount on Health insurance.
A yearly budget for Conferences/meetup/self-learning.

You will be working in small teams to rapidly design, prototype and iterate game ideas from yourself and the team, so although a master of your own discipline, you will still have a huge voice when it comes to concepting and designing Games at BANDAI NAMCO Mobile. Due to this, it is imperative that you can bring a deep understanding of the Mobile F2P Gaming Market. 
 Although an experienced voice when it comes to Video Games, you understand that there is always more to learn from both your peers and from the community. You are flexible and open to change within a fast-paced team environment and a firm believer that world class games begin with a world class team. You understand that processes are not written in stone to be followed regardless, that everything can always be changed and improved, and that change can bring innovation. 

Game Lead

We are currently looking for an experienced and empowering Game Lead to join our growing studio. You will make sure the development of the game runs smoothly and that the team can do their best work. You will remove blocks, manage external suppliers if needed and represent the team within the rest of the company. This role is perfect for a versatile self-starter who understands the concept of servant leadership.

At BNM we make game related decisions as a group effort. Everyone in the team is responsible for delivering the best possible experience. So, whether you're a Community Manager or Coder, Data Scientist or Designer your voice is always heard. While decisions are made like this, it's still important to have someone who can lead and drive the overall development and makes sure that everyone is tuned in and performing as highly as possible.

Creación del calendario semanal y mensual de contenidos: copy post, in image text, in video text, scripts, blog posts, etc.

""Logistics for a sustainable world."" That is the mission at the heart of Stuart Delivery. While customer expectations around the delivery experience are skyrocketing, cities are limiting traditional logistics methods to improve congestion, pollution and liveability. The convergence of these two trends means that a disruptive approach to last mile delivery is not a nice-to-have but rather an inevitability.

Stuart sits at the crossroads of the future, using our best-in-class proprietary dispatch technology to connect small and big businesses alike to a shared fleet of geolocalised couriers. The result? Efficient, reliable, eco-friendly delivery to help retailers to meet their customers' demands.

We launched in 2015 with a big vision and a handful of clients. Five years later, couriers on our platform complete tens of millions of deliveries annually for the biggest brands across retail, e-commerce, grocery and food.

Stuart is an equal opportunity employer and we value diversity at our company. We don't discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status or disability status.

The Steering Committee further aims to open a 5-year tenure-track position in 2023 or 2024 with the same profile as the current contract, to which the postdoctoral researcher might apply to remain at the ICP; however, this will depend on budgetary availability.

Eligibility criteria

Selection Criteria. The weight of the various selection criteria (in %) is specified below. During the shortlisting phase, each eligible applicant will be assigned a 0-10 score to each criterion. During the evaluation phase, shortlisted candidates will be assigned a 0-10 score to each merit included in the selection criteria (as specified on the ICP recruitment protocol), each with a corresponding percentage determined by the Selection Committee before the call is closed.

Average merit scores will be used to compute weighted average selection criteria scores, and the sum of the latter will be the total raw scoring of the candidate. A relative scoring will be computed as raw scoring multiplied by maximum career duration among all the shortlisted candidates divided by career duration of the candidate. Reductions in career duration apply not to penalize diversified career paths and career breaks (see recruitment protocol for details; the candidates are responsible to provide such details). A corrected scoring will be computed as (raw scoring * 0.8) + (relative scoring * 0.2). An interview by ICP members of the Selection Committee will be mandatory for all shortlisted candidates. Each member of the committee will rate the interview (excellent = 1.25; good = 1.15; neutral = 1.0; bad = 0.85; terrible = 0.75) and a correction factor computed as the arithmetic mean of the interview ratings. The final scoring will be computed as corrected scoring * interview correction factor. Candidates will be prioritized based on their final scoring.

Description of the project: The art of organic synthesis and reaction discovery relies on logic-guided thought processes that often involve hypovalent carbon reactive species and their corresponding stabilized equivalent forms. However, not all of the possible carbon reactive intermediates and their reactivity rules have attracted the same attention by the synthetic community. This is mainly because of the perception of the lack of synthetic utility and importantly, because of the challenges associated with controlling its extreme reactivity and lack of efficient sources. The main goal of this project is to invent and develop new chemical reactions based on equivalents of carbyne species –the monovalent carbon species–, able to transform feedstock & fine chemicals into complex organic matter. Our initial works on carbyne equivalent generation and metal-carbynoids were recently published (Nature 2018, 554, 86; JACS, 2019, 141, 15509)

We are looking for a self-motivated, creative and independent individual that fulfill the following requirements:
PhD in Organic chemistry or related field.

The Institute of Chemical Research of Catalonia (ICIQ) is seeking a Postdoctoral Researcher to join the Suero research group. This position will be funded by the European Research Council – ERC project CARBYNE (865554).

ICIQ is committed to performing excellent research at the frontier of knowledge in the broad area of chemistry (Catalysis, Artificial Photosynthesis, Activation of Small Molecules, Photovoltaics, Functional Molecular Assemblies and Chemical Biology, from either theoretical or experimental perspectives). The institute also aims at training the future generation of scientists by offering high-quality educational programmes to master, PhD students and postdoctoral researchers (Full details on

Our mission is to lead, from the vantage point of molecular science, cross-strategies for solving major social and economic challenges, such as climate change and sustainable supply of energetic and raw materials, thereby contributing to the establishment of a knowledge-based economy and improving citizens’ quality of life in our influence area.

Description of the project: The art of organic synthesis and reaction discovery relies on logic-guided thought processes that often involve hypovalent carbon reactive species and their corresponding stabilized equivalent forms. However, not all of the possible carbon reactive intermediates and their reactivity rules have attracted the same attention by the synthetic community. This is mainly because of the perception of the lack of synthetic utility and importantly, because of the challenges associated with controlling its extreme reactivity and lack of efficient sources. The main goal of this project is to invent and develop new chemical reactions based on equivalents of carbyne species –the monovalent carbon species–, able to transform feedstock & fine chemicals into complex organic matter. Our initial works on carbyne equivalent generation and metal-carbynoids were recently published (Nature 2018, 554, 86; JACS, 2019, 141, 15509)

We are looking for a self-motivated, creative and independent individual that fulfill the following requirements:
PhD in Organic chemistry or related field.
Proven track record in discovery and development of novel catalytic concepts.
Experiences in photochemistry, photocatalysis, metal-catalyzed C–H bond functionalization, radical chemistry or asymmetric catalysis.
Proven good level of written and spoken English.
Strong commitment for scientific excellence.

Responsibilities
Discovery and development of new chemical reactions based on equivalents of carbyne species.
Writing reports, preparation of scientific articles, and presentation of results in group meetings and conferences.
Maintenance of laboratory equipment.
Complete documentation of research results.

986,Universitat Pompeu Fabra - Barcelona,MetaWireless Early-Stage Researcher,Barcelona, 1 mes,106,Algo de responsabilidad,Enseñanza superior Software Investigación,Jornada completa,Investigación Análisis Tecnología de la información,"Offer Description

The Wireless & Secure Communications (WiSeCom) Research Group at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain is seeking to appoint one high-calibre Early Stage Researcher (ESR) to join the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network on ‘Future Wireless Communications Empowered by Reconfigurable Intelligent Meta-Surfaces’ (MetaWireless).

Wireless connectivity has become a pillar of our society. The growth of wireless traffic is relentless, forecast to reach a staggering worldwide aggregate of 5,016 exabytes by 2030, along with bit rates of 1 Tb/s and new services related to sensing, localization, low-latency, and ultra-reliability. While the performance of wireless networks has improved phenomenally over the last decades, progress is by now pushing against fundamental limits and the mechanisms that have sustained these huge improvements are starting to falter. New evolutionary leaps are called for in order to ensure that the aforementioned forecasts can become a reality. To date, every wireless system has abided by the premise that the propagation radio channel is fixed by nature and cannot be tampered with, but only compensated through ever more sophisticated transmission/reception schemes. A potential evolutionary leap for 6G-and-beyond networks is to break free from the postulate that channels are uncontrollable factors. Serving such a vision, MetaWireless pursues the disruptive idea of designing wireless networks by treating the environment itself as a quantity to be controlled and optimized. Precisely, the manipulation of the wireless environment can be made possible by incorporating reconfigurable intelligent surfaces. These are planar structures, made of meta-materials and electromagnetically discontinuous, which do not adhere to conventional reflection and diffraction laws; rather, they can modify in a controllable fashion the phase and wavefront of impinging radio waves. If deployed to coat objects, walls, or building facades, they could allow customizing in real time the electromagnetic response of environments. Making this vision a reality requires the training of a new generation of researchers and a multidisciplinary effort involving wireless communications, physics, electromagnetic theory, and computational learning, which are the ingredients that define the MetaWireless project.
