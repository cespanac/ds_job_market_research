Actualmente buscan un Data Engineer para ser el owner del desarrollo del Data Lake, Data Warehouse, aportando los mejores métodos y de la mejor forma para la ingestión de datos. Desarrollar las herramientas y frameworks útiles para conectar el equipo de Data con el de IT, construyendo pipelines escalables y, al mismo tiempo, haciendo uso de diferentes tecnologías. (esto no parece decir mucho más que cualquier otra oferta, verdad? Pero ahora sigo)
Equipo: Estarás trabajando con otros 3 data analyst, la head de data, y en estrecha colaboración con el DevOps y el equipo IT.

El must de stack: Actualmente están migrando todo su data stack a Google Cloud (Bigquery, Composer). Pero, conocedores de que no es tan común el expertise de esta herramienta en el mercado (aunque cada vez se usa más), estarían buscando a alguien que venga de AWS (Redshift y demás) así como Airflow, y tampoco una excesiva seniority, porque la idea es que tenga los fundamentos y dentro de la empresa poder formarse y crecer. A destacar que como Benefit ellos tienen suscripción a una famosa plataforma de aprendizaje, así como tienen asignado tiempo semanal, en horario laboral, para formarse.
Softskills: Ambiente increíble, dicho por varios miembros del equipo, ya que los conocemos desde hace tiempo. Buscarían a alguien dinámico, que le mole el ecosistema startup, y no le de miedo lanzarse a la piscina a aprender cosas nuevas y últimas tecnologías.
Y esto no es todo, además de un paquete de benefits al que habría que añadir mucho team building, y clases de idiomas, se añade su política 100% remote friendly (aunque restringido por ahora a las personas en el mismo huso horario que España), por lo que, si así lo quieres, y más allá del COVID, puedes continuar trabajando desde tu casa, la cafetería o un lugar paradisíaco de la costa ?
Challengue + la leche de compañía + gran ambiente laboral + 100% remote + muchas más cosas.
Cuál es el salario máximo que ofrecen por esta ganga de oportunidad? 45.000 € bruto/anual

Do you thrive when you explore all of the possibilities for tech to fail or succeed?

ThoughtWorks is a global software consultancy with an aim to create a positive impact on the world through technology. Our community of technologists thinks disruptively to deliver pragmatic solutions for our clients' most complex challenges. We are curious minds who come together as collaborative and inclusive teams to push boundaries, free to be ourselves and make our mark in tech.

Our developers have been contributing code to major organizations and open source projects for over 25 years. They’ve also been writing books, speaking at conferences and helping push software development forward, changing companies and even industries along the way. We passionately believe that software quality is driven by open communication, review and collaboration. That’s why we’re such vehement supporters of open source and have made significant contributions to open source tools for testing, continuous delivery (GoCD), continuous integration (CruiseControl), machine learning and healthcare.

As consultants, we work with our clients to ensure we’re evolving their technology and empowering adaptive mindsets to meet their business goals. You could influence the digital strategy of a retail giant, build a bold new mobile application for a bank or redesign platforms using event sourcing and intelligent data pipelines. You will learn to use the latest Lean and Agile thinking, create pragmatic solutions to solve mission-critical problems and challenge yourself every day.

Woven between all of the stages of the development process is the work of a Quality Analyst: the technologist who sees building solutions like a kaleidoscope of possibilities for things to break. By collaborating with each team member—Developer, Business Analyst, Designer, etc.—they ensure quality is thoughtfully examined in both processes and technology. QAs also aspire to be more than testers; they’re team motivators and strive to encourage all teammates to weave quality into their mindsets and code.

You’ll Spend Time On The Following
You will proactively seek out ways to avoid common software-testing problems such as test case duplication, flaky tests, and maintainability
You will pair with devs to read and analyze code and provide feedback about tests
You will seamlessly partner with clients, Business Analysts, and Project Managers to create and prioritize test plans while establishing yourself as a trusted voice with testing methods, strategies, and tools
You will provide input for and champion system testability
Advocate QA expertise to the broader tech community outside of ThoughtWorks, speaking at conferences and acting as a mentor for more junior-level QAs
Strive for quality to be built and aspire to shift quality to the left
Apply theoretical knowledge to practice and willingly offer improvements on code, tests, testability and suggest tools and frameworks to use
You will examine end-to-end processes in addition to backend testing, ensuring quality is embedded throughout
You will produce and implement test strategies during the software development process
Drive the creation of a reliable automated testing suite with strong reporting capabilities that ensures simple, effective analysis of failures for your team to use
Champion high-functioning teams and enable transitions where necessary
Extend your passion for quality assurance practices to enabling the client, helping coach a client’s team to adopt a testing mindset


Here’s What We’re Looking For
You have worked as a Quality Analyst as part of a wider development team, pairing with Devs and ideally Business Analysts, Infrastructure Engineers, and Designers
You have experience with Agile, code management, deployment strategies and different types of nonfunctional testing
You’re a sleuth when it comes to finding bugs, coming up with scenarios and edge cases along with a solid understanding of best practices such as TDD, BDD, CI/CD and the Practical Test Pyramid
You are comfortable with different types and techniques in functional testing including exploratory, boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning
You have exposure to and experience in using defect tracking and management tools
An understanding of how to perform better white box testing using code
You know what a test strategy is and can produce one and you’re able to zoom out to the big picture and identify gaps in quality
You’re resilient in ambiguous situations and can approach and tackle challenges from multiple perspectives
You are seen as an influential team leader and always advocate for quality as a shared team responsibility, yet are open to change when needed
An ability to assess strengths amongst your teammates and distribute quality-related tasks when needed

“Logistics for a sustainable world.” That is the mission at the heart of Stuart Delivery. While customer expectations around the delivery experience are skyrocketing, cities are limiting traditional logistics methods to improve congestion, pollution and liveability. The convergence of these two trends means that a disruptive approach to last-mile delivery is not a nice-to-have but rather an inevitability.

Stuart sits at the crossroads of the future, using our best-in-class proprietary dispatch technology to connect small and big businesses alike to a shared fleet of geolocalised couriers. The result? Efficient, reliable, eco-friendly delivery to help retailers to meet their customers’ demands.

Do you thrive when you explore all of the possibilities for tech to fail or succeed?

ThoughtWorks is a global software consultancy with an aim to create a positive impact on the world through technology. Our community of technologists thinks disruptively to deliver pragmatic solutions for our clients' most complex challenges. We are curious minds who come together as collaborative and inclusive teams to push boundaries, free to be ourselves and make our mark in tech.

Our developers have been contributing code to major organizations and open source projects for over 25 years. They’ve also been writing books, speaking at conferences and helping push software development forward, changing companies and even industries along the way. We passionately believe that software quality is driven by open communication, review and collaboration. That’s why we’re such vehement supporters of open source and have made significant contributions to open source tools for testing, continuous delivery (GoCD), continuous integration (CruiseControl), machine learning and healthcare.

As consultants, we work with our clients to ensure we’re evolving their technology and empowering adaptive mindsets to meet their business goals. You could influence the digital strategy of a retail giant, build a bold new mobile application for a bank or redesign platforms using event sourcing and intelligent data pipelines. You will learn to use the latest Lean and Agile thinking, create pragmatic solutions to solve mission-critical problems and challenge yourself every day.

Woven between all of the stages of the development process is the work of a Quality Analyst: the technologist who sees building solutions like a kaleidoscope of possibilities for things to break. By collaborating with each team member—Developer, Business Analyst, Designer, etc.—they ensure quality is thoughtfully examined in both processes and technology. QAs also aspire to be more than testers; they’re team motivators and strive to encourage all teammates to weave quality into their mindsets and code.

Apply theoretical knowledge to practice and willingly offer improvements on code, tests, testability and suggest tools and frameworks to use
You will examine end-to-end processes in addition to backend testing, ensuring quality is embedded throughout
You will produce and implement test strategies during the software development process
Drive the creation of a reliable automated testing suite with strong reporting capabilities that ensures simple, effective analysis of failures for your team to use
Champion high-functioning teams and enable transitions where necessary
Extend your passion for quality assurance practices to enabling the client, helping coach a client’s team to adopt a testing mindset


Here’s What We’re Looking For
You have worked as a Quality Analyst as part of a wider development team, pairing with Devs and ideally Business Analysts, Infrastructure Engineers, and Designers
You have experience with Agile, code management, deployment strategies and different types of nonfunctional testing
Solid understanding of best practices such as TDD, BDD, CI/CD and the Practical Test Pyramid
You have experience with API automation, are comfortable in databases, and love to write simple code in order to test applications
You are comfortable with different types and techniques in functional testing including exploratory, boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning
You have exposure to and experience in using defect tracking and management tools
An understanding of how to perform better white box testing using code
You know what a test strategy is and can produce one

Design and implement high-quality and performant Python code within our powerful ETL.
Automate external integrations with our Data Lake and Data Warehouse.
Automate complex solutions that might require to train, build, and deploy a series of Machine Learning algorithms (no previous experience with ML required).

Examples of Projects and Responsibilities
You receive a Jupyter Notebook made by one of our Data Analysts which contained a prototype of a data processing pipeline that generate very important data for our stakeholder.

You need to understand it, define which is the best way to automate it (Airflow Python DAG, using Spark, external tools, etc.), and start the implementation by yourself or together with other team members.
The previous example works in a similar way for Data Scientists when they come requesting help with automation about how to train a Machine Learning model that we want to re-evaluate on a weekly basis. Ideally, we want the results of the evaluation to be automatically computed and shared via a Slack channel, so we can quickly review them and decide if the model can be moved to production.

El equilibrio perfecto entre una gran idea disruptiva y el bien que hace a su sector.
Actualmente buscan un Data Engineer para ser el owner del desarrollo del Data Lake, Data Warehouse, aportando los mejores métodos y de la mejor forma para la ingestión de datos. Desarrollar las herramientas y frameworks útiles para conectar el equipo de Data con el de IT, construyendo pipelines escalables y, al mismo tiempo, haciendo uso de diferentes tecnologías. (esto no parece decir mucho más que cualquier otra oferta, verdad? Pero ahora sigo)
Equipo: Estarás trabajando con otros 3 data analyst, la head de data, y en estrecha colaboración con el DevOps y el equipo IT.

El must de stack: Actualmente están migrando todo su data stack a Google Cloud (Bigquery, Composer). Pero, conocedores de que no es tan común el expertise de esta herramienta en el mercado (aunque cada vez se usa más), estarían buscando a alguien que venga de AWS (Redshift y demás) así como Airflow, y tampoco una excesiva seniority, porque la idea es que tenga los fundamentos y dentro de la empresa poder formarse y crecer. A destacar que como Benefit ellos tienen suscripción a una famosa plataforma de aprendizaje, así como tienen asignado tiempo semanal, en horario laboral, para formarse.
Softskills: Ambiente increíble, dicho por varios miembros del equipo, ya que los conocemos desde hace tiempo. Buscarían a alguien dinámico, que le mole el ecosistema startup, y no le de miedo lanzarse a la piscina a aprender cosas nuevas y últimas tecnologías.
Y esto no es todo, además de un paquete de benefits al que habría que añadir mucho team building, y clases de idiomas, se añade su política 100% remote friendly (aunque restringido por ahora a las personas en el mismo huso horario que España), por lo que, si así lo quieres, y más allá del COVID, puedes continuar trabajando desde tu casa, la cafetería o un lugar paradisíaco de la costa ?
Challengue + la leche de compañía + gran ambiente laboral + 100% remote + muchas más cosas.
Cuál es el salario máximo que ofrecen por esta ganga de oportunidad? 45.000 € bruto/anual

 We are a team of passionate machine learning specialists who are always looking for new ways to contribute to Adsmurai’s success. As such, we are constantly learning new skills and trying new things. One way we achieve this is by constant training and devoting time to work on our own ideas (and aligning them with Adsmurai’s goals). We strongly believe that the best way to achieve great things is through teamwork and constant communication and continuous improvement. We periodically revise the way we work and try new methodologies and approaches in order to improve ourselves.

 We work on areas of the company where data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence can have an impact on user needs.

Ensuring high availability of our products.
Monitorization of deployed solutions.


We don’t place much importance in a particular set of technologies since we are always looking forward to expand our toolkit in order to find the technology better suited for the problem at hand. Even so, knowledge of technologies we have used in the past is a plus. Some of these technologies include: Airflow, Gitlab0s CI-CD, Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery, Storage, Composer, SQL), Docker and Python. Additionally, knoeledge about Redis, Scala, Spark, Kubernetes and ML-related frameworks such as Tensorflow would be awesome. 


We offer:

245,BMAT Music Innovators,"Data Engineer - Digital music distribution, Python",Barcelona, 6 días,177,Algo de responsabilidad,Servicios y tecnologías de la información,Jornada completa,Ingeniería Tecnología de la información,"About BMAT 

BMAT started in 2005 when a group of engineers with a passion for music decided to spin-off from an audio research lab in Barcelona. The company started with an idea – to index all the music in the world – and a mission – to better the music eco-system – and a team of nerds eager to learn how to build a successful business. Today the company has grown to more than a hundred people - spread across Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Lima, Los Angeles, Milan, São Paulo, London, Paris, Oslo, New York, Johannesburg, Singapore, Tokyo, and Moscow - that team up to deliver daily 1 million identifications and 3 billion matches to our partners from all over the music industry.
 
 Our Culture 

We love music. It makes our lives a zillion times better. And we want to give something back to her (yes, to us music is a lady). Make her life easier and her future brighter. We apply our scientific, data-infused brains to tell everyone what music has been played – so that creators get the recognition they deserve. We hear everything everywhere and tell everyone who wants to know. ‘What plays around will come back around’ we say. We believe by helping this happen we can make a positive change in the music ecosystem and enjoy talent for another million years.

We are a team of pretty decent people who enjoy working with each other. We’re open-minded and well-traveled, coming from all parts of the world. We like coffee, tea, chai, and mate all the same. We’ve got rappers, producers, cello players, DJs, and songwriters. The passion for music, the excitement for technology and Barcelona as a backdrop has proven to make a good combination. We say there is a BMAT touch. We believe it has to do with being passionate, obsessive, nice, generous, honest, self-motivated, entrepreneurial, intrepid, crazy, extraordinary, creative, agile, human, friendly, smart, witty, talented, naive, optimistic, surprising, sensual, and nerdy, but not very hipster (unfortunately).

 What You Will Be Doing
 As part of the engineering team of the Digital business unit, your responsibilities will be to build, improve and scale the products that power one of the most complete music data processing systems in the world. We use agile values to improve our day to day performance. We are connected to more than 45 digital service providers such as Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music, Deezer or Amazon. They provide us with digital sales reports (DSRs), which we parse, reconcile, match and translate into royalty statements, among others, in order to provide insight to our partners, the collective management organisations and publishers of the world.

In addition, we also provide on-demand audio identification services that enable our partners to be in control of user-generated content (e.g. YouTube, Facebook, SoundCloud) and increase revenues and traceability from videos containing their music.

Our digital distribution system has already processed 162.000 DSRs with 87 billion transactions from over 250 countries, and currently ingests 650 million online music transactions per month
in a horizontally scalable architecture powered by Amazon Web Services. Our main development technology is Python along with some of its frameworks, such as Django and Flask. We also use Docker to speed up our developments and deployments.
 Moreover at BMAT we want to have the most complete music metadata database in the world. As part of our team you will help dealing with tons of music metadata, to help us reach our goal faster, adding value to the team and creating cool stuff.
   All About You

Proficient in Python.
Code with test coverage.
Experience developing ETLs integrating data from different sources.
Experience with entity reconciliation, data matching.
Love digging into (music) data: understand it, find patterns, clean it, find value.

We've learnt that we thrive on learning from each other, so we don't just welcome but actively hire a range of open-minded people from all walks of life. Our team is made up of people with different backgrounds, perspectives, orientations, abilities, musical tastes, dress sense and time-zones - but we all have one common goal: Making the music world a better place. With equal opportunities for everyone, BMAT is a pretty nice place to work.

253,BMAT Music Innovators,"Data Engineer - Digital music distribution, Python",Barcelona, 6 días,177,Algo de responsabilidad,Servicios y tecnologías de la información,Jornada completa,Ingeniería Tecnología de la información,"About BMAT 

BMAT started in 2005 when a group of engineers with a passion for music decided to spin-off from an audio research lab in Barcelona. The company started with an idea – to index all the music in the world – and a mission – to better the music eco-system – and a team of nerds eager to learn how to build a successful business. Today the company has grown to more than a hundred people - spread across Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Lima, Los Angeles, Milan, São Paulo, London, Paris, Oslo, New York, Johannesburg, Singapore, Tokyo, and Moscow - that team up to deliver daily 1 million identifications and 3 billion matches to our partners from all over the music industry.
 
 Our Culture 

We love music. It makes our lives a zillion times better. And we want to give something back to her (yes, to us music is a lady). Make her life easier and her future brighter. We apply our scientific, data-infused brains to tell everyone what music has been played – so that creators get the recognition they deserve. We hear everything everywhere and tell everyone who wants to know. ‘What plays around will come back around’ we say. We believe by helping this happen we can make a positive change in the music ecosystem and enjoy talent for another million years.

We are a team of pretty decent people who enjoy working with each other. We’re open-minded and well-traveled, coming from all parts of the world. We like coffee, tea, chai, and mate all the same. We’ve got rappers, producers, cello players, DJs, and songwriters. The passion for music, the excitement for technology and Barcelona as a backdrop has proven to make a good combination. We say there is a BMAT touch. We believe it has to do with being passionate, obsessive, nice, generous, honest, self-motivated, entrepreneurial, intrepid, crazy, extraordinary, creative, agile, human, friendly, smart, witty, talented, naive, optimistic, surprising, sensual, and nerdy, but not very hipster (unfortunately).

 What You Will Be Doing
 As part of the engineering team of the Digital business unit, your responsibilities will be to build, improve and scale the products that power one of the most complete music data processing systems in the world. We use agile values to improve our day to day performance. We are connected to more than 45 digital service providers such as Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music, Deezer or Amazon. They provide us with digital sales reports (DSRs), which we parse, reconcile, match and translate into royalty statements, among others, in order to provide insight to our partners, the collective management organisations and publishers of the world.

In addition, we also provide on-demand audio identification services that enable our partners to be in control of user-generated content (e.g. YouTube, Facebook, SoundCloud) and increase revenues and traceability from videos containing their music.

Our digital distribution system has already processed 162.000 DSRs with 87 billion transactions from over 250 countries, and currently ingests 650 million online music transactions per month
in a horizontally scalable architecture powered by Amazon Web Services. Our main development technology is Python along with some of its frameworks, such as Django and Flask. We also use Docker to speed up our developments and deployments.
 Moreover at BMAT we want to have the most complete music metadata database in the world. As part of our team you will help dealing with tons of music metadata, to help us reach our goal faster, adding value to the team and creating cool stuff.
   All About You

Proficient in Python.
Code with test coverage.
Experience developing ETLs integrating data from different sources.
Experience with entity reconciliation, data matching.
Love digging into (music) data: understand it, find patterns, clean it, find value.
Experience working with document-oriented databases (MongoDB, Elasticsearch).
Linux and Git experience.
Experience with software design life cycle and good practices (Code Reviews, Refactoring).
Forecast software and infrastructure scalability issues and capacity to prevent them.
Good documentation and communication skills.
Proactive team player with high-quality awareness and independent working attitude.
You value a DevOps culture.


Bonus Track

Experience with Docker. 
Experience with AWS.
Experience with Kafka/event-driven architectures.
Experience with distributed systems.
Experience scaling platforms.
Experience with HTTP APIs and frontend apps.

 You Can Enjoy 

Full-time job.
Flexibility on working location and working hours.
Free Spanish and English classes.
Flat hierarchy.
Full autonomy of your duties.
Becoming part of a diverse and multicultural team based in Barcelona obsessed with bettering the music industry.
 
Diverse perspectives drive innovation, and innovation is kind of our thing. Our open-minded and flexible culture organically fosters this diversity. We've learnt that we thrive on learning from each other, so we don't just welcome but actively hire a range of open-minded people from all walks of life. Our team is made up of people with different backgrounds, perspectives, orientations, abilities, musical tastes, dress sense and time-zones - but we all have one common goal: Making the music world a better place. With equal opportunities for everyone, BMAT is a pretty nice place to work.

271,Jobandtalent,Lead Data Engineer (Data Team),Barcelona, 3 semanas,424,no_data,Internet,Jornada completa,Tecnología de la información,"Who we are: We are a workforce on-demand company that heavily relies on tech. We integrate the complete process of selecting, hiring, and managing employees, being the first in digitizing all the steps, introducing Artificial Intelligence solutions in multiple phases, obtaining faster and higher-quality service for our clients, and great satisfaction and loyalty for our workers.
Our Impact on Society: Our vision is to create a long-term job security condition for our workers while providing flexible solutions to our clients. We can do this by concatenating different short-term contracts and minimizing–or completely removing–their unemployed time. We want to remove the need for finding a job ever again. 
Data-Driven: Being the owner of the entire hiring funnel, workforce management, and working experience, give us very unique data that we transform into powerful knowledge to make better decisions, improve job-candidate matches, estimate quality and affinity, and share performance feedback with our workers and clients. We are the most advanced workforce on-demand company thanks to our data and the way we use it.
Great Challenges for the Data Team: Integrating very different AI solutions to improve the experience for both our workers and employers (Shift Optimization, Machine Learning algorithms, Quality Score Estimations, Document recognition, etc.), relying on a very powerful ETL that permits endless automatizations while keeping the focus on data quality.
Growth Overview: An annual growth of 170%, available in multiple countries: the UK, Spain, Germany, Sweden, Mexico, Colombia, France, and more are coming. HQ in Madrid with a second big presence in Barcelona and some remote workers in the UK, The Netherlands, and the USA. And finally, some of our great clients are Amazon, XPOLogistics, Cabify, Santander, Just Eat, etc. 
 You will be the main referent of our data architecture, leading the design and implementation decisions of our data pipelines. This role includes the possibility of managing the Data Automation team. 
 The Data Team is very independent of the rest of the Tech and Product teams. We build and manage our services that run our AI models as well as our data storages to quickly process the data we need, and let the Data Scientist performing the “Time Travel” to properly train our algorithms. A quick insight about our architecture and tools:
We are building our new data lake and data warehouse directly in AWS S3, synchronizing the data via DMS, and consolidate it via Hudi. This data will be accessible by multiple Redshift  clusters that allow us to quickly scale-up across all the countries. In addition as data is stored in S3 this could be exploited via Athena or an ad-hoc Spark job. 
We have multiple queue systems from which we consume data coming from the JobandTalent Message broker  while filling up our data storage. 
We use Airflow as our ETL which allows us to break down any complex problem/process into smaller ones. Each component can be implemented directly in Python, or any other language since we could execute any docker container in AWS Fargate. 
We are integrating different 3rd party data (Kustomer, Salesforce, etc.). We keep iterating in the best way to incorporate this data to our Datalake which allow our users to exploit this data.
 You need to have proven experience in these areas, being eager to learn and improve, while enjoying taking responsibility. You need to be very hands-on, able to explore different solutions to our problems and needs.  
 Requirements and Skills
Technical degree preferably in Engineering or Quantitative field.
Experience managing ETL or similar Data Workflows 
Experience in leading data architecture decisions and similar responsibilities.
Previous practical experience with Big Data technologies knowledge, batch and real-time (Hadoop, Spark, Hudi, Spark Streaming, Flink, etc.).
Extensive experience with production-ready code (not scripting code).
Extremely skilled programmer (e.g., unittest, production/staging experience). 
Python proficiency, and ideally experience with other programming languages such as Java, Scala.

399,Universitat Pompeu Fabra - Barcelona,MetaWireless Early-Stage Researcher,Barcelona, 1 mes,106,Algo de responsabilidad,Enseñanza superior Software Investigación,Jornada completa,Investigación Análisis Tecnología de la información,"Offer Description

The Wireless & Secure Communications (WiSeCom) Research Group at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain is seeking to appoint one high-calibre Early Stage Researcher (ESR) to join the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network on ‘Future Wireless Communications Empowered by Reconfigurable Intelligent Meta-Surfaces’ (MetaWireless).

Wireless connectivity has become a pillar of our society. The growth of wireless traffic is relentless, forecast to reach a staggering worldwide aggregate of 5,016 exabytes by 2030, along with bit rates of 1 Tb/s and new services related to sensing, localization, low-latency, and ultra-reliability. While the performance of wireless networks has improved phenomenally over the last decades, progress is by now pushing against fundamental limits and the mechanisms that have sustained these huge improvements are starting to falter. New evolutionary leaps are called for in order to ensure that the aforementioned forecasts can become a reality. To date, every wireless system has abided by the premise that the propagation radio channel is fixed by nature and cannot be tampered with, but only compensated through ever more sophisticated transmission/reception schemes. A potential evolutionary leap for 6G-and-beyond networks is to break free from the postulate that channels are uncontrollable factors. Serving such a vision, MetaWireless pursues the disruptive idea of designing wireless networks by treating the environment itself as a quantity to be controlled and optimized. Precisely, the manipulation of the wireless environment can be made possible by incorporating reconfigurable intelligent surfaces. These are planar structures, made of meta-materials and electromagnetically discontinuous, which do not adhere to conventional reflection and diffraction laws; rather, they can modify in a controllable fashion the phase and wavefront of impinging radio waves. If deployed to coat objects, walls, or building facades, they could allow customizing in real time the electromagnetic response of environments. Making this vision a reality requires the training of a new generation of researchers and a multidisciplinary effort involving wireless communications, physics, electromagnetic theory, and computational learning, which are the ingredients that define the MetaWireless project.

We want to let you know more about us and our project, but first we're going to share with you a little bit of our history

At Openbank, the 100% digital bank of the Santander Group, we are in the midst of a digital transformation and international expansion process. To achieve this, we are recruiting a team of great professionals, who love technology, innovation, the digital world and of course achieving great challenges. Sounds good.

We were born in 1994 as pioneers in digital banking and since then we have worked to innovate every day. Proof of this is that we launched the first native application for iPad and implemented WhatsApp as a way of communicating with our users. We currently have more than 1 million customers who have placed their trust in us, and that is why we take care of the quality and security of all our services. In 2017 we launched a new web and app platform, using the latest cloud-based technology and with an API layer for all services. That same year we created Open Digital Services (ODS), our technology subsidiary, to recruit the team that would help us achieve our greatest challenge: international growth and technological development. Today, we are developing our Core Banking and have already landed in the Netherlands, Germany and Portugal, and will soon land in Argentina.

As you can see, we haven’t stopped growing and innovating, working in a start-up format, using agile methodologies and making use of the latest technologies. We work with AWS, Microservices Architecture, Mobile Development (iOS and Android) and Big Data Ecosystems among others. Our goal is to take our users' experience to the next level. We are a flexible and fast adapting team, able to work with displaced teams and with a culture that makes us different. We have social and diversity clubs, such as our Padel or LGTBI+ Club and we have more than 30 different nationalities which allows us to have a multicultural and changing environment.

 Our major differentiated strengths are first to have demonstrated in the past many successful FSM software rollouts in many major companies.

This is Us.
 A team of more than one thousand people sharing an idea: doing our bit in helping our clients create a better future for themselves, providing them with the tools they need to get where they want to go.
 In today’s world, we know this happens because we are a fully online bank. We were born out of that idea and 20 years on, technology, simplicity and transparency continue to be the ingredients of the recipe that leaves the best taste in our mouths: being more than just a bank, someone useful in the lives of the millions of clients who have chosen us.

Who You'll Work With
You will be based in Lisbon or Madrid and will be part of McKinsey Digital.

As part of this group, you’ll join a global team working on everything from IT modernization and strategy to agile, cloud, cybersecurity, and digital transformation. You’ll typically work on projects across all industries and functions and will be fully integrated with the rest of our global firm.

You’ll also work with colleagues from across McKinsey & Company to help our clients deliver breakthrough products, experiences, and businesses, both on technology and non-technology topics.

Our office culture is casual and social, with an emphasis on education and innovation. We have the freedom to try new ideas, experiment and are expected to be constantly learning and growing. There is also a strong emphasis on mentoring others in the group, enabling them to grow and learn.

When you join McKinsey as a Business Analyst (BA), you are joining a firm that will challenge you and invest in your professional development. In this role you will work on the best teams to help the best organizations in the world – in private, public, and social sectors – solve their most difficult problems. You will also work with many experts, from data scientists and researchers to software and app designers.

You’ll gain new skills and build on the strengths you bring to the firm. Business Analysts (BA) receive exceptional training as well as frequent coaching and mentoring from colleagues on their teams. This support includes a Partner from your local office or practice assigned to you to help guide your career as well as several weeks of formal training in your first two years as a BA. Additionally, you’ll receive guidance and support from your local office in the selection of client projects, helping you to develop your skills and build your network.

We view the BA position as the start of a rewarding, challenging, and highly flexible career with McKinsey. During your first few years with the firm, you will serve as a BA on multiple client engagements and work with a number of colleagues and clients in a range of industry and functional areas. We encourage you to explore different content areas or geographies through a 2 year-long rotation with one of our practices (e.g., corporate finance, social sector, healthcare, operations) or global offices; many do this after two years as a generalist BA.

Following your BA tenure, assuming good performance, you will move into a post-graduate school role. Some BAs will take advantage of the opportunity to get outside experience through a secondment (externship) with a private sector or social sector client with the firm’s support. Others may choose to pursue graduate school with support from the firm.

463,Ironhack,Mid-Senior Data Analyst,Madrid, 1 mes,456,Algo de responsabilidad,Servicios y tecnologías de la información Software Internet,Media jornada,Tecnología de la información,"#About Ironhack

Ironhack is an education startup that was founded to disrupt the way tech education works!

Doesn’t it seem odd that we’ve been learning the same way since the Industrial Revolution? Virtually all industries are pushing the limits on how to do things faster, better, and more efficiently. Yet, for the most part, people feel stuck on a 4+ year (and usually quite expensive) path that often results in an unfulfilling career path.

We empower students to create a new path - one that leads to meaningful careers in software development, product design or data analytics in a fraction of the time and cost of traditional education.

Our higher purpose is to transform the education space to be unapologetically outcomes-driven. Whether students are looking to change careers, get a promotion, skip University, or start their own company, we work tirelessly every day to make sure this path is as quick, immersive, and accessible as possible. Hearing these success stories is what gets us out of bed each day, excited to come to work :)

It’s with this mindset that we’ve become one of the key global players in bridging the digital skills gap, serving both those looking to get into tech, as well as the companies hungry for tech talent.

Quick Facts
Founded in 2013 by Wharton and Harvard grads
Operations in Miami, Madrid, Barcelona, Paris, Mexico City, Lisbon, Amsterdam, Sao Paulo and Berlin
100% YoY Growth (help us to keep it going!)
Graduated over 6500 students

We Are Working Hard On Three Main Points
Making data available to everyone (developing a platform that provides accessibility and autonomy to the employees to query the data)
Spreading the knowledge of data around the company: an essential part of autonomy is to be able to extract valuable knowledge from the data. That’s why we are training all the Ironhack’s employees on necessary data skills.
Improving the quality of our data: data is useless if the quality is low. We are working hard on being aware of the quality of the data.
In the future, we’ll work also on providing Advanced Analytics to the company, such as forecasting, clustering, and different Machine Learning and statistics techniques. So the challenges are varied, and you will be able to develop yourself in different areas.

You will be close to
Technical aspects of the data such as analysis, quality, reporting, and generation
Non-technical aspects of the data: working on our culture, helping people to be autonomous
You will be responsible for
Definition, analysis, design, and development of data quality models
Definition, analysis, design, and development of analytical processes and models
Training employees in basic data skills such as dashboarding, querying and analyzing data
Developing business cases to focus on the market with higher potential impact
Data lineage and governance
Your day-to-day. We work with agile methodologies, so you will know your priorities, but also you will be responsible for how you plan your day-to-day work.
Your Skills And Experience
At least 3 years of experience as Data Analyst
Degree in a Quantitative field or related courses
Demonstrated knowledge of BI projects
Demonstrated hands-on experience with a programming language (R, Python, etc)

Being a team player is a must
Hands-on experience building a strong governance environment
Experience in working and delivering end-to-end projects independently
Liking and understanding how to work in an agile environment
Comfortable with English speaking
What we offer in the data team
The possibility to learn about many different business processes: we work with the marketing team, education, sales, etc. You will learn what their main processes are and how they use the data
The possibility to work with people from different countries. It is always interesting to know better different cultures
We are a small team with high impact
30 - 35k gross year, depending on the profile
Is this you?

To achieve this, we are recruiting a team of great professionals, who love technology, innovation, the digital world and of course achieving great challenges. Sounds good.

We were born in 1994 as pioneers in digital banking and since then we have worked to innovate every day. Proof of this is that we launched the first native application for iPad and implemented WhatsApp as a way of communicating with our users. We currently have more than 1 million customers who have placed their trust in us, and that is why we take care of the quality and security of all our services. In 2017 we launched a new web and app platform, using the latest cloud-based technology and with an API layer for all services. That same year we created Open Digital Services (ODS), our technology subsidiary, to recruit the team that would help us achieve our greatest challenge: international growth and technological development. Today, we are developing our Core Banking and have already landed in the Netherlands, Germany and Portugal, and will soon land in Argentina.

As you can see, we haven’t stopped growing and innovating, working in a start-up format, using agile methodologies and making use of the latest technologies. We work with AWS, Microservices Architecture, Mobile Development (iOS and Android) and Big Data Ecosystems among others. Our goal is to take our users' experience to the next level. We are a flexible and fast adapting team, able to work with displaced teams and with a culture that makes us different. We have social and diversity clubs, such as our Padel or LGTBI+ Club and we have more than 30 different nationalities which allows us to have a multicultural and changing environment.

Now that you know us a little better... Would you like to join our ODS team and grow with us?

At Returnly, we help brands that care about shopper loyalty offer better product returns. We are a financial technology services company that builds award-winning products that drive repurchase behavior and customer loyalty. We’re backed by smart money VCs in Fintech including some prominent members of the Paypal Mafia. Our headquarters are in San Francisco Financial District and we have offices in Chicago and Madrid. We are on a mission to de-risk online commerce and are building a team of amazingly talented people to help us do it.

About The Role

At Returnly, we value you as a whole person. We care about the skillset you bring to the table, but more importantly, we care about the kind of person you are and the culture and attitude that you bring. As a Senior Data Analyst, you will work with our Product, Marketing, Data Science, Sales, Customer Success, and Finance teams to define and create meaningful analyses to help drive revenue, fix processes, and monitor impact.

Remoteness

We have an office, and we prefer seeing each other often, but we already had a healthy WFH culture before Covid-19 came so when it happened, we just switched to every-day WFH.

Schedule

We have a very flexible approach to working hours. You can stop to go to the gym, get your little ones to or from school, meditate or do whatever you need or want. There is a need for a certain amount of overlap with Pacific Coast working hours needed for meetings and collaboration that does not fit into asynchronous communications, however we try to prioritise those, and your main collaborators are based on Spain. A lot of people at Returnly have families, we understand the sometimes unpredictable nature of life and we support everyone taking care of their loved ones and themselves, and we trust everyone to take advantage of this flexibility in a responsible way.

Equipment

You will be provided with an Apple laptop and whatever you need to do your job comfortably and productively. As we are now unable to enjoy our awesome offices, special provisions to help you set up at home will be addressed.

Benefits

Additionally, Returnly offers some benefits to all its employees, like private medical insurance, extra vacation days, team lunches, etc. Employees are eligible for extra benefits related to health & wellness and home utilities reimbursement.

We actively seek to hire individuals with different perspectives, and we are eager to continue diversifying our company's culture. We strive to be an inclusive, supportive place where you can do the best work of your career.

Our offices are in Madrid, Spain, but the position is open to anyone with experience working remotely. Some overlap with Central European Time is expected though, for those times when a video call is the most efficient way to communicate.

About the job:

Our Data Platform is what supports the Analytics needs and data-driven projects of the company. It is built around a modern ELT pipeline deployed on AWS and uses Python, Spark, dbt, Redshift, and a range of AWS services.

As a Data Engineer on our Data Engineering Squad, you will support, improve and extend our Data Platform. Your work will empower our Analysts and Data Scientists, enable data-driven Product features, and generally support the data-informed culture at Lingokids.
More specifically, you will:

Design, build and support modern and scalable data pipelines using 3rd party platforms or internal solutions.
Collaborate with data scientists, other engineers, and stakeholders to understand what data is required and how best to make it available in our Data Platform.
Support the daily work of our Data Scientists by ensuring they have easy access to data and tools (development environment, notebook instances, etc.).
Write and maintain code to orchestrate our ETL workflows.
Improve the design and data feeding of our Data Lake.
Help and train Data Scientists to optimize SQL queries for performance.
Provide data and infrastructure for building and deploying ML models to production.
Use best practices around CI/CD, automation, testing, and monitoring of analytics pipelines (inspired by DataOps).

About you:

The ideal teammate for us would be someone who believes that communication, empathy, inquisitiveness, and open-mindedness are fundamental to being successful in any endeavor.

You should:

Be interested in building a platform that enables our Data Analysts and Data Scientists.
Be fluent with one or more high-level programming languages (Python, Ruby, Java, Scala, or similar).
Be comfortable with analytical SQL.
Be familiar with software development best practices and their applications to Analytics (version control, testing, CI/CD, automation).
Have experience building modern ETL pipelines, possibly at a large scale.
Have experience working with a modern data warehouse (Redshift, Snowflake, BigQuery, or similar).
A self-driven approach to learning new technologies and moving projects forward.

We consider the following as nice to have:

Experience working with Data Scientists and Analysts.
An interest in data quality and governance.
Experience in the BigData ecosystem (Hadoop, Spark, PrestoDB, …).
Experience with a Cloud Data Warehouse (Redshift, Snowflake, …).
Familiarity with infrastructure and automation tools (Terraform, Ansible, or similar).

English is a must. We are a multicultural team, and we are providing a service in English so, we don't care about certificates, but we expect you to be able to communicate fluently.
You should feel equally comfortable communicating in long-form writing. Given the circumstances, we have become a fully remote company. We are firm believers that being articulate in both spoken and written long-form asynchronous communication is key to working efficiently together.

If you think you don't tick all the boxes, we'd still love to hear from you. Nobody checks every box, and we are looking for someone excited to join the team.

Benefits of working at Lingokids

Flexible hours and remote working. We care about the results you bring to the team. 9 to 6 and constant commuting is not for us either.

¿Quiénes somos nosotros?

Aplazame es una FinTech parte del grupo WiZink Bank que ofrece financiación instantánea para compras online y offline. Sin papeleo, sin letra pequeña y sin llamar a tu banco. Sólo tú con tu móvil y en cuestión de segundos.

Nuestro objetivo es ofrecer productos financieros simples, transparentes y justos que merezcan la confianza de la gente y les permita comprar con flexibilidad. Si quieres participar en el reto que supone trabajar y aprender en una de las historias de éxito más importantes del panorama nacional, queremos saber de ti.

¿Cómo será tu día a día?

Investigación de mejoras de los modelos existente: propuesta de hipótesis, investigación y conclusiones *accionables* son nuestro ABC.
Desarrollo de nuevos modelos que no existían previamente para los cuales hay que plantear soluciones interesantes. Por ejemplo, sistemas de recomendación, optimización de canales de marketing, medición de A/B testing con multi-armed bandits o detección de anomalías son algunos de los retos que tenemos que resolver.
Desarrollo Python, hacemos ciencia de datos y por lo tanto hacemos software (bien). Estamos trabajando duramente para que a final del Q1 cumplamos el  Joel Test en su totalidad
Comunicación y más comunicación con el resto de las áreas. Somos un equipo cross que permea en toda la compañía y tiene afán de transmitir.
Participar en la mejora del plan estratégico y añadir ideas al backlog es parte de tu responsabilidad. No somos un producto sencillo y hay retos en todas partes que requieren soluciones ingeniosas. Trabajamos muchísimo con los equipos de producto para crear una visión a largo plazo de productos basados en datos.

¿A quién nos gustaría encontrar?

Puedes ser tú si tienes una experiencia mínima de 5 años preferiblemente en productos cercanos al crédito en checkout, con conocimiento sobre fraude online y riesgo crediticio.
 Es indispensable:
 Manejo *muy* fluido con el stack típico de DS en Python y facilidad para aprender nuevas herramientas.
Conocimiento estadístico, especialmente en escenarios complejos como estimación con datos censurados o muestreos no aleatorios o rare event sampling. Preferimos entender que ocurre debajo del framework.
*Buen* Python: Si crees que el diseño y el estilo es algo más que estética este es tu sitio.
Trabajo en equipo y capacidad de comunicación: no somos rockstars, trabajamos con muchas otras personas, las entendemos y nos hacemos entender.
Curiosidad intelectual por resolver problemas complejos y no totalmente definidos.
 Tendremos muy en cuenta, pero no es estrictamente necesario:
 Conocimiento en scoring de riesgos y fraude y en la industria financiera.
Experiencia con modelado bayesiano, toma de decisiones secuencial y reinforcement learning.

Excelencia técnica: (intentamos) hacer todo bien o muy bien. Como en todas partes, tenemos limitaciones de tiempo que nos impiden tener todo en perfecto estado. Pero tendemos a mejorar con la excelencia como objetivo.
Curiosidad intelectual y crecimiento personal: Hacemos ciencia, somos inquietos, tenemos curiosidad, nos hacemos preguntas que nadie nos ha preguntado y damos respuestas que nos sorprenden a nosotros mismos. El aprendizaje es el principal motor de tu propio plan de crecimiento personal.
Zero ego: Ego is the enemy. Para hacer ciencia se tiene que separar al autor del resultado. No nos enamoramos de ninguna idea y todo es mejorable, siempre. Está permitido decir al CDO que sus ideas son terribles.
Trabajo en equipo: los problemas y éxitos de cada uno son de todos. Colaboramos de forma autónoma y nos interesamos por los retos de nuestros compañeros (de Data y otras áreas)
Autonomía responsable: somos muy flexibles con la forma de trabajo de cada uno: trabajo en remoto, de forma asíncrona, permitiendo la conciliación y la autonomía en la ejecución.

Our mission is to lead, from the vantage point of molecular science, cross-strategies for solving major social and economic challenges, such as climate change and sustainable supply of energetic and raw materials, thereby contributing to the establishment of a knowledge-based economy and improving citizens’ quality of life in our influence area.

Description of the project: The art of organic synthesis and reaction discovery relies on logic-guided thought processes that often involve hypovalent carbon reactive species and their corresponding stabilized equivalent forms. However, not all of the possible carbon reactive intermediates and their reactivity rules have attracted the same attention by the synthetic community. This is mainly because of the perception of the lack of synthetic utility and importantly, because of the challenges associated with controlling its extreme reactivity and lack of efficient sources. The main goal of this project is to invent and develop new chemical reactions based on equivalents of carbyne species –the monovalent carbon species–, able to transform feedstock & fine chemicals into complex organic matter. Our initial works on carbyne equivalent generation and metal-carbynoids were recently published (Nature 2018, 554, 86; JACS, 2019, 141, 15509)

We are looking for a self-motivated, creative and independent individual that fulfill the following requirements:
PhD in Organic chemistry or related field.

Our power

Our power

Enza Zaden is a vegetable breeding company that develops vegetable varieties. We produce and sell the seeds of these varieties all over the world. Both for conventional and organic growers. Our goal is to grant people access to healthy vegetables. Anywhere in the world. Every day, more than 460 million people worldwide eat our vegetables. So, we are getting there ... but there is still enough work to be done! Of course, we look further than present needs. In 2050, when there will be about 10 billion inhabitants on our planet, we also want to make sure that people have access to healthy vegetables. To achieve this, our vegetable breeders work with the best that nature offers. Supported by state-of-the-art technologies to speed up our breeding process. And that is really necessary, because currently the development of a new vegetable variety takes at least 6 years. We focus on higher yield, resistance to diseases and pests and climate extremes such as heat and drought. And on taste, shelf life and nutrients. The results? Strong, healthy tasty and climate-proof vegetable varieties with higher yield per square meter and less need of crop protection products or fertilizer. In short, sustainability is truly in our DNA.
